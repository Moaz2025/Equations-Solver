# Equations-Solver
## Phase 1
The aim of this phase is to compare and analyze the behavior of the different
numerical methods used for solving system of linear equations:
1. Gauss Elimination.
2. Gauss Jordan.
3. LU Decomposition.
4. Gauss Seidil.
5. Jacobi Iteration.

## Phase 2
The aim of this phase is to compare and analyze the behavior of the different
numerical methods used for calculating the roots of equations:
1. Bisection
2. False-Position
3. Fixed point
4. Newton-Raphson
5. Secant Method.

## GUI
We used JavaFX in GUI.

## Libraries
WE used exp4j library to build expressions in phase 2.
